  <b>This Website!</b><br>
<p>This website is currently developed entirely on my pixel 7a. I'm forced to do this sort of thing because my laptop recently died in a power surge. I use Acode Editor and have very limited intellisense/snippets available which makes doing this very tedious. But, I have a passion for programming and I refuse to let a minor setback like a busted laptop stop me. </p><br>
<p><b>FEATURES OF THIS PAGE:<br></b>
The colors are designed to perform a 100% invert if your browser is set to a dark mode. This may not work with all browsers or dark-reader extensions.<br><br> If you've used a linktree page before then you know how to operate my website!.<br><br> It's taken me 3 hours to write this website. Please consider funding part of my next laptop purchase via the cashapp link in my twitter bio!</p>
